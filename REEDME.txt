--- CONTEXT ---
Official football data organised and formatted in csv files ready for download is quite hard to come by. Stats providers are hesitant to release their data to anyone and everyone, even if it's for academic purposes. That was my exact dilemma which prompted me to scrape and extract it myself. Now that it's at your disposal, have fun with it.

--- CONTENT ---
The data was acquired from the Premier League website and is representative of seasons 2006/2007 to 2017/2018. Visit both sets to get a detailed description of what each entails. The data used in the application is representative only from 2010/2011 because from this season we obtained all the possible stats.
